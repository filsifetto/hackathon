# Assets

Static assets for the project: images, media, and branding. Add logos, illustrations, or shared media here so they can be referenced from the avatar frontend or other apps without duplicating files.

## Usage

- Reference from the avatar frontend via `public/images/` in that app, or copy/symlink from here when needed.
- Keep this folder for **project-wide** assets; app-specific assets can stay in each app (e.g. `src/avatar/frontend/public/`).

## Conventions

- Use clear, descriptive names (e.g. `party-logo.svg`, `hero-banner.png`).
- Prefer vector (SVG) for logos and icons when possible.
