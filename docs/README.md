# Documentation

This folder contains project-wide documentation. Use this index to find what you need quickly.

## Documentation index

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [**API_SETUP.md**](API_SETUP.md) | How to add and manage API keys (OpenAI, ElevenLabs, etc.) securely. **Start here** before running the avatar. |
| [**PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md**](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) | High-level layout of the repo, where code and assets live, and conventions. |

## Quick links by task

- **First-time setup (API keys):** [API_SETUP.md](API_SETUP.md)
- **Understanding the repo layout:** [PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md)
- **Running the party avatar:** [../src/avatar/README.md](../src/avatar/README.md)
- **Editing the party’s positions:** [../src/avatar/content/party_program.md](../src/avatar/content/party_program.md)

## Adding new documentation

- Keep one topic per file; use a clear filename (e.g. `DEPLOYMENT.md`, `TESTING.md`).
- Add the new file to the table above and to the “Quick links” section if it’s a common task.
- Write in plain language: assume a new contributor can follow the steps without prior context.
